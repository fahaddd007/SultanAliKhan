            <p><b>Heart Specialties :</b> An electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG) is one of the simplest and fastest procedures used to assess the heart. Electrodes (small, plastic patches) are placed at certain locations on the child’s chest, arms and legs. When the electrodes are connected to the ECG machine by lead wires, the electrical activity of the child’s heart is measured. The cardiologist uses this information to decide whether the child needs further tests or the proper course of treatment for the child’s heart problems.</p>
